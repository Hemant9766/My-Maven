# My-Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Certainly! I'll explain Maven in simpler terms for someone from a non-IT background.

Imagine you want to build a model airplane from a kit. The kit comes with all the pieces you need, like the wings, body, and propellers. You also have a set of instructions that tell you how to put everything together step by step.
In this analogy:
1. **You** are like the developer or builder.
2. **The model airplane kit** is like the software project you're working on.
3. **The pieces of the airplane** are like the different parts of your software, such as code files, images, and configuration settings.
4. **The instructions** are like the rules and steps you follow to build your software.
Now, let's relate this to Maven:
1. **Maven** is like a magical helper that helps you build your model airplane (software project) easily and correctly.
2. **The pieces of the airplane (software)** are the different parts of your project, like the code you write and other files your project needs.
3. **The instructions** in the case of Maven are the rules and settings that tell Maven how to put all the pieces of your project together.
